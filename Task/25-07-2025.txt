Practice Questions for React State Management (Click Events Only):

1. Create a simple counter application with increment, decrement and reset buttons. Display the current count using onClick handlers only.

2. Build a toggle switch that changes between "On" and "Off" states using a single onClick handler. Add styling to show the state.

3. Create a random password generator with a single "Generate" button that creates an 8-character password. Add a "Copy" button.

   - Starts/stops on click
   - Resets on click
   - Shows formatted time

5. Create a calculator application using states that:
   - Has number buttons (0-9) and operation buttons (+, -, *, /, =)
